## BARCENOLA AIRBNB LISTING ANALYSIS

The growing number of vacation rentals in Barcelona has resulted in a significant rise in the cost of buying and renting a home.
In addition to the issue of housing availability, placing tourists in residential buildings can occasionally result in noise complaints, the degradation of communal espaces, and an increased sense of unease. Also the city's infrastructure can also be overloaded.

Given that Airbnb is the primary platform for facilitating vacation rentals, Barcelona City Council is in need of a thorough analysis of the properties listed in the platform in order to examine the distribution of this kind of properties in each neighbourhood, its features, user experiences,  prices, and any other aspect to understand how this market operates.

The final goal will be to determine if it is necessary to establish certain restrictions on this type of rentals in order to develop a more sustainable tourism strategy.
